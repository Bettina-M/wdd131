        <p id="intro">Hello there! I'm Bettina Menya, from Nairobi, Kenya—home to epic wildlife scenes and stunning parks! I wear many hats: I'm a mother, wife, and currently a student at BYU-Idaho, pursuing a degree in Web Development. I love the gospel of Jesus Christ because it sprinkles a little heavenly wisdom into every nook and cranny of our lives, including our relationships.

            The scriptures and the wisdom of General Authorities have been my go-to guides for navigating the wild ride of marriage, guiding us to become better each day as we strive to live the gospel. I’m excited to share some of the golden nuggets I've picked up along the way through this blog. Whether you're single, married, divorced, or on the lookout for your perfect match, I hope you’ll find a treasure trove of inspiration and guidance here. Happy reading!
